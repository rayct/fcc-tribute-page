            <strong>Family Life</strong> - <em>Hawking was married to Jane Beryl Wilde/Hawking for 30 years having 3 Children - Robert, born in 1967, Lucy, born in 1969, and Timothy, born in 1979, before separating in 1990 only to divorce 5 years later. Jane went on to marry musician Jonathan Hellyer Jones. However, she continued to support Hawking due to his health problems as he continued to work. In the postlude to her 2007 memoir Travelling to Infinity, she says of Hawking after his second divorce (from nurse Elaine Mason) "We are able to associate freely again and enjoy many a family occasion together. It has been quite like old times...".

During her marriage to Hawking, while dealing with the progression of his illness, Jane suffered from depression. In a 2004 interview, she cited her Christian faith as giving her hope during her marriage and the depression she experienced as a result of being his then-caregiver. In that interview, Jane noted the irony in her faith-based strength to support him in light of Stephen Hawking's well-known atheism.</em>
